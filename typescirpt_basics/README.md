1. TypeScript is a high-level programming language that adds static typing with optional type annotations to JavaScript.
2. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that introduces type safety and helps developers build more robust and maintainable web applications.
3. It is designed for developing large applications and transpiles to JavaScript.
4. Developed by Microsoft as free and open-source software released under an Apache License 2.0.
5. Anders Hejlsberg, a distinguished engineer at Microsoft, started developing TypeScript in 2010, and its first public release, known as TypeScript 0.8, became available in 2012.
6. The main benefit of TypeScript is that it can highlight unexpected behavior in your code, lowering the chance of bugs.
7. TypeScript adoption has surged across enterprise teams, SaaS startups, and large-scale open-source projects, while JavaScript remains the de facto standard for fast prototyping, frontend scripting, and dynamic applications with limited scope.
8. TypeScript is a syntactic superset of JavaScript which adds static typing. This basically means that TypeScript adds syntax on top of JavaScript, allowing developers to add types. TypeScript being a "Syntactic Superset" means that it shares the same base syntax as JavaScript, but adds something to it.
